        <text>The reason for saying he is " audacious " is that , as a public servant , he violently beat others over a minor disagreement ; furthermore , he used a great deal of violence such as " choking " and " kicking heavily with his feet , " resulting in a " left scapula fracture and left clavicle dislocation " ; we therefore see how despotic Li is and how low his quality is during ordinary times .</text>
