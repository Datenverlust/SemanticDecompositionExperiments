		<note>AFFECT-V NOTES: Frames file for 'affect' based on survey of
initial sentences of big corpus; adjectival usage based on BOLT-4,5.
Member of Vncls amuse-31.1. (from affect.01-v)

EFFECT-N NOTES: Based on verb entry affect.01; corresponds to
Vncls amuse-31.1. Differs from verb frame in arg2 because mention of
affect itself is possible with noun. (from effect.01-n)

AFFECTED-J NOTES: Automatically created by Julia as an alias
file for unification. (from affected.01-j)

Usage note from AHD: Affect and effect are often confused
because they sound alike and have related meanings. First, bear in
mind that there are two words spelled affect. One means "to put on a
false show of," as in She affected a British accent. The other
affect, the one that is confused with effect, is both a noun and a
verb. As a noun it is uncommon and means roughly "emotion." It is
pronounced with stress on the first syllable rather than the second.
Note that affect does not have a noun sense meaning "an influence
that brings about a change." As a verb, affect is most commonly used
in the sense of "to cause a change in:" the ways in which smoking
affects health. The verb effect means "to bring about or execute":
medical treatment designed to effect a cure. Its corresponding noun
means "a result." Thus if someone affects something, there is likely
to be an effect of some kind, and from this may arise some of the
confusion. People who stop smoking will see beneficial health
effects, but not beneficial health affects. The verbs produce
important differences in meaning. The sentence These measures have
been designed to effect savings implies that the measures will cause
new savings to come about. Using affect in the very similar sentence
These measures will affect savings implies that the measures will
cause a change in savings that have already been realized.</note>

		<note>EFFECT-V NOTES: Frames file for 'effect' based on sentences in
wsj. No Verbnet entry.The difference between 'effect' and 'affect'is
one of the greatpitfalls of English. 'Affect' means to
influence,'effect' means tobring about or execute. (from
effect.01-v)

EFFECT-N NOTES: The only usage we really feel belongs in this roleset is along the lines 
of "put into effect" and "take effect". The vast majority of instances of 'effect-n' are 
going to go in the affect.01 roleset.</note>
