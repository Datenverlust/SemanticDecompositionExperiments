      <note>THROUGH-J NOTES: Added by Julia. This is currently half-formed-- the finished frame will include an MWE alias 'go_through', which I mention because it may be helpful in understanding the full intention of this sense and why it is split off from through.02. Because 'go_through' was already covered by go.12, that roleset will be rolled into this one.</note>

        <text>That girl has been through hell and back with me</text>
        <note>This is an experience that is described using the spatial framework of through.02. If the intention was really to describe a Dantean trip through hell as an actual location, it would be appropriate to use through.02. But since this is referring to a hellish experience, we can use through.03.</note>
