Open Roget's 1.4
----------------
Thank you for downloading The Open Roget's Thesaurus.  This is an open source version of 
Roget's Thesaurus.  This package includes xml files version of the Thesaurus and a java
API as well as several java applications that make use of the API and some other examples
that make use of the API.

Java version 1.6 or higher is needed to run this version.  Please download Open Roget's 1.1.1
if you need a version to run with Java 1.5, or recompile the source code.

This package and future updates can be found at: http://rogets.site.uottawa.ca/

-------------------
NEW TO THIS VERSION
-------------------

-- Up 5500 new words have been added all over Roget's Thesaurus.
-- Users can switch between the original 1911 Roget's Thesaurus, an edition updated with 
2200 words (called "1911X1") and an edition updated with 5500 words (called "1911X5")
This is accomplished when constructing an object that uses the thesaurus.
A new RogetELKB object can be created:
	* new RogetELKB("1911")
	* new RogetELKB("1911X1")
	* new RogetELKB("1911X5")
A new SemDist object can be created:
	* new SemDist("1911")
	* new SemDist("1911X1")
	* new SemDist("1911X5")
A new WordPower object can be created:
	* new WordPower("1911")
	* new WordPower("1911X1")
	* new WordPower("1911X5")
A new RogetSentenceFactory object can be created:
	* new RogetSentenceFactory("1911")
	* new RogetSentenceFactory("1911X1")
	* new RogetSentenceFactory("1911X5")
	
The samples provided here all use 1911X5, but can be easily adjusted.

-----------
BASIC SETUP
-----------
The directory roget_elkb contains all the xml files as well as a serialized Index object
for Roget's Thesaurus.  This directory (roget_elkb) should be moved to your home directory.

All the sample programs and applications can be run from the main directory (open_rogets_1.4).
These programs will make use of rogets-1.4.jar. 

----------------------
INDEX SETUP (optional)
----------------------

It is not necessary to make changes to the index, however in the folder roget_elkb/1911/index
(also roget_elkb/1911X1/index and roget_elkb/1911X5/index) there are two index files 
elkbIndex_allBreak.dat and elkbIndex_noBreak.dat.

-- elkbIndex_allBreak.dat is the index where all phrases are broken up into multiple words 
and each word is indexed
-- elkbIndex_noBreak.dat is the index where phrases are not broken up though phrases are still
indexed as phrases.

To change the index that your installation is using copy one of these files into the
roget_elkb/1911/ directory and rename it elkbIndex.dat.  As a default elkbIndex_allBreak.dat
is the index file used.

---------
EXECUTION
---------
This folder should also contain a jar called rogets.jar

To execute it using Java 1.6 use:
> java -cp rogets-1.4.jar ca.site.elkb.RogetELKB


You may require crimson.jar.  It can be obtained at: http://xml.apache.org/crimson/, however,
a copy of crimson.jar version 1.1.3 and its license are provided in this distribution.

To run it in use the command:

> java -cp rogets-1.4.jar:crimson.jar ca.site.elkb.RogetELKB

------------
APPLICATIONS
------------
There are three applications, the driver, lexical Chains and semDist.  The driver can be
used to construct a new index that can be placed in the roget_elkb/1911 folder.  It is not
necessary to run this program to generate the index since it has been provided already.

The lexical Chains application builds lexical chains out of a file of text.  It also makes
use of the stops.txt file found in the main directory.  Executed:
java -cp .:rogets-1.4.jar lexicalChain.LexicalChain <1911 | 1911X1 | 1911X5> <input file>
e.g.
java -cp .:rogets-1.4.jar lexicalChain.LexicalChain 1911 src/lexicalChain/train.txt

The semDist application finds the semantic distance between pairs of words
java -cp .:rogets-1.4.jar semDist.SemDist <1911 | 1911X1 | 1911X5> <input file>
e.g.
java -cp .:rogets-1.4.jar semDist.SemDist 1911 src/semDist/MillerCharles.txt

The wordPower application picks the best synonym from a set of candidates
java -cp .:rogets-1.4.jar wordPower.WordPower <1911 | 1911X1 | 1911X5> <input file>
e.g.
java -cp .:rogets-1.4.jar wordPower.WordPower 1911 src/wordPower/rd_july2000.txt

The wordCluster application clusters groups of words (see radioactive_materials.txt and 
radioactive_materials_res.txt for file formats)
java -cp .:rogets-1.4.jar wordCluster.WordCluster <1911 | 1911X1 | 1911X5> <input file> <output file>
e.g.
java -cp .:rogets-1.4.jar wordCluster.WordCluster 1911 src/wordCluster/radioactive_materials.txt src/wordCluster/output.txt

All of these applications require rogets.jar and possibly crimson.jar (depending on your
system) to be in the class path.

A Driver is included which can be used to rebuild the index.  We do not recommend using it
unless you know what you are doing.

-----------
SAMPLE CODE
-----------
There are five sample programs provided with this distribution that demonstrate the use of
several functions in the API as well as methods of integrating the SemDist and WordPower
functions into your own java program.  The files are as follows:

** UseIndex **
Demonstrates use of the index for searching terms

java -cp .:rogets-1.4.jar samples.UseIndex

** UseCategories **
Demonstrates how to access information about the different categories (higher levels) of Roget's Thesaurus

java -cp .:rogets-1.4.jar samples.UseCategories

** UseText **
Demonstrates how to access the text in the xml files (lower levels) of Roget's Thesaurus.

java -cp .:rogets-1.4.jar samples.UseText

** UseSemDist **
Shows how to integrate the SemDist function into a java program.

java -cp .:rogets-1.4.jar samples.UseSemDist

** UseWordPower **
Shows how to integrate the WordPower function (synonym selection) into a java program.

java -cp .:rogets-1.4.jar samples.UseWordPower

** UseSentenceSim **
Shows how to use the Roget's and simple sentence representation systems and how to find sentence similarity.

java -cp .:rogets-1.4.jar samples.UseSentenceSim

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
JavaDoc documentation can be found in the doc folder.  Examples of the API can also be found
in the samples folder.

The source for rogets.jar can be found in the folder roget_source.
